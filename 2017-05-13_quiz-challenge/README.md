#Challenge to create a... 
```JavaScript
JS Quiz
```

###### I am using Object Oriented JS,
this, Math.random, and any other skills in my toolbox.

###### 5/16/17 - As of today's inspirations
I am noticing I am doing code backflips to get this working.  Which I'm 100% okay with.  Once I keep getting some attempts in, I will go to the reference source and compare, contrast, learn, and incorporate.

###### 5/17/17 - Finished my challenge.  
About to check the reference, and I can refactor.  

After review, I didn't do half bad!  In fact, some things were "better" in my opinion than the reference.  

*I did learn 2 things, though (along with figuring out how to pick a truly random alternate answer.  Before I was just looping backwards through the answers)*

- If you examine my code, you'll see in the app.js a `QArray` to house my questions now.
- And in quiz.js you'll see I created 2 new prototype methods to make some of the code more readable and understandable: getCurrentQuestion() and getAnswer()
