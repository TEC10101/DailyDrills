#Challenge to create a JS Quiz

I am using Object Oriented JS, this, random, and any other skills in my toolbox.

5/16/17 - As of today's inspirations, I am noticing I am doing code backflips to get this working.  Which I'm 100% okay with.  Once I keep getting some attempts in, I will go to the reference source and compare, contrast, learn, and incorporate.
